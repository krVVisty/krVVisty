## Hi there, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently immersed in a 12-week intensive Software Development Bootcamp at Tech Educators, honing my skills in full-stack development.
I spend my days building hands-on projects â€” from websites and interactive games to full-stack applications â€” while mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, SQL, and practical APIs, Git, testing, and deployment.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Advanced JavaScript, React best practices, API integration, and full-stack project workflows.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Web development, coding projects, tech career paths, or productivity in learning new skills.
ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammarunowski/
âš¡ Fun fact: I love turning complex coding challenges into creative solutions.
